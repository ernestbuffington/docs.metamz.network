Trusted Hosts
-------------

If the HumHub application is working behind a reverse proxy (especially an SSL terminator), the reverse proxy must be marked as trusted host.

The following headers are only accepted by a trusted host:

- X-Forwarded-For
- X-Forwarded-Host
- X-Forwarded-Proto
- Front-End-Https
- X-Rewrite-Url

The trusted host must be specified in the configuration file ``protected/config/web.php``.

**Example configuration:**

```php
<?php
/**
 * This file provides to overwrite the default HumHub / Yii configuration by your local Web environments
 * @see http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-concept-configurations.html
 * @see http://docs.humhub.org/admin-installation-configuration.html
 * @see http://docs.humhub.org/dev-environment.html
 */
return [
    'components' => [
        'request' => [
            'trustedHosts' => ['192.168.0.0/24']
        ],

    ]
];

``` 

An array key is an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address in CIDR notation for matching a client.

An array value is a list of headers to trust. These will be matched against $secureHeaders to determine which headers are allowed to be sent by a specified host. The case of the header names must be the same as specified in $secureHeaders.

You can find more information in the Yii2 documentation: https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/2.0/yii-web-request#$trustedHosts-detail

HTTPS/SSL Detection
-------------------

Typically HumHub detects the currently used protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and uses this automatically to generate links.

With an SSL Terminating ReverseProxy this should also be done using HTTP header information. If this detection fails, the generation of HTTPS URLs can be forced via the configuration files.

Example (`protected/config/web.php`): 

```php

<?php

// Enfore HTTPS link generation
$_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';

return [
    // Further configuration options
];
```


Caching
-------

If the proxy also acts as a cache, it is important that query parameters are taken into account.

When static files are modified (e.g. during an upgrade), HumHub automatically adds a new query parameter value (cache bust).

The following paths can be cached:

- /assets/*
- /themes/*
- /uploads/*
- /static/*

**Example NGINX caching snippet (incomplete):**

```conf
location ~ ^/(assets|themes|uploads|static)/.*$ {
  add_header                X-ECache 1;
  add_header                X-ECache-Key    $host$uri$is_args$args;
  add_header                X-ECache-Status $upstream_cache_status;

  proxy_ignore_headers      "Expires";
  proxy_ignore_headers      "Cache-Control";

  proxy_cache_key           "$host$uri$is_args$args";
  proxy_cache_valid         200 1d;

  proxy_pass                $target;
}
```
