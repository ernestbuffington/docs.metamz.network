Spaces are one of the core concepts of HumHub. They represent separate sections, in which content can be created and shared and where Users can interact with each other.

Besides the essential features they also have an integrated Rights Management System, an own access policy, and visibility options for the Space itself as well as for individual content. They can also be easily extended with additional tools ('modules') such as Calendar, Task Manager or a Wiki via the [HumHub Marketplace](https://marketplace.humhub.com).
