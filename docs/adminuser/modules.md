## Marketplace


### Activation by license key

Before non-free modules can be downloaded and updated from our Module Marketplace, a valid license key must be provided.

For modules purchased directly from HumHub, this activation is automatic and the modules are available immediately.

Modules purchased from a third party vendor or migrated to a new HumHub installation will require the license key to be entered manually.

Please follow the steps below: 

- Open Marketplace section: `Administration` -> `Modules`
- Click on tab `Purchases`
- Now enter the license key without any white spaces into the field `Licence key` and click `Register`
- The module is now available for installation

:::warning
To activate a license of the **HumHub - Professional Edition**, use following steps: `Administration` -> `Information` -> `Upgrade to Professional Edition`.
