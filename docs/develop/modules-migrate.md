Module Migration Guide
======================

This guide provides useful information about migrating your custom modules in order to keep them compatible with new HumHub versions.
You should keep your modules up-to-date by removing deprecations and align code breaking changes of the platform and ideally test your
modules against new HumHub version. Also keep in mind to align the `minVersion` of your module when using new features.

You can execute code for specific versions by using the `version_compare` function as:

```php
if (version_compare(Yii::$app->version, '1.3', '=>')) {
    // Use some 1.3+ features here
} else {
     // Compatibility code for older versions
}
```

Version 1.14
------------

- New [content soft delete](content.md#delete-content) mechanism. Do not use ~~`ContentActiveRecord::delete()`~~ directly. Exceptions:
  - Make sure to hard delete module content on module disable (e.g. [Example](https://github.com/humhub/tasks/pull/230/files))
  - Hard Delete should be also used in Integrity Checker callbacks
 
- New `Content::$state` feature (Drafts, Soft Delete)

- New Deprecations:
  - `protected/humhub/modules/user/authclient/{Facebook,GitHub,Google,LinkedIn,Live,Twitter}.php`
  - `humhub/modules/user/authclient/AuthClientHelper`
  - `humhub/modules/user/components/User::canDeleteAccount()`
  - `humhub/modules/user/components/User::canChangePassword()` (deleted)
  - `humhub/modules/user/components/User::canChangeEmail()` (deleted)

Version 1.10
------------

- Removed `Followable` behavior methods `getFollowingCount()`, `getFollowingObjects($query)`, `getFollowers()`
- File versioning support has been introduced. Use `$file->setStoredFile()` instead of ~~`$file->store->set()`~~ See [File module documentation](files.md#replacemodify).

- Updated to PHPUnit 8.5 (#4757)
- Added `EVENT_BEFORE_CHECKING_USER_STATUS` in `AuthController` 


Version 1.8
-----------

- AdminMenu: A visibility must always be specified for custom menu entries. [See example code.](https://github.com/humhub/humhub/blob/2ff4053d66743755cecdd57cfb8b46dae78e1a3d/protected/humhub/modules/admin/widgets/AdminMenu.php#L40)
- User Account "Security" page renamed to "Permissions". (Changed action id and views)
- Removed unused legacy widget `modules/admin/widgets/UserSettingMenu.php` 
- Groups can now have multiple default spaces. The `Group::getSpace()` method has been removed and replaced by `Group::getGroupSpaces()`. 

### Richtext changes

In 1.8 we've introduced some changes in the Richtext API by introducing converter classes as:

- `RichTextToShortTextConverter`: Used to convert Richtext to a html preview without text formatting. 
- `RichTextToHtmlTextConverter`: Used to convert Richtext to plain html e.g. in html mails
- `RichTextToMarkdownTextConverter`: Used to convert Richtext to plain markdown without HumHub richtext extensions
- `RichTextToPlainTextConverter`: Used to convert Richtext to plain text e.g. for text mails

Richtext conversion can also be achieved by the `RichText::convert()` function.

In this step we've added the following deprecations:

- `humhub\libs\Markdown` is deprecated in favor of `RichTextToHtmlConverter` or `RichText::convert()`
- `humhub\libs\MarkdownPreview` is deprecated in favor of `RichTextToShortTextConverter` or `RichText::convert()`
- `RichText:$minimal` option was deprecated in favor of `RichTextToShortTextConverter` or `RichText::convert()` should be used for previews.
- `RichText:$maxLength` option was deprecated, Richtext content should not be cut anymore, only `RichTextToShortTextConverter`
  should be used for previews.
- `ProsemirrorRichText::parseOutput()` was used for additional Richtext extensions and should be replaced with a `RichTextExtension` implementation
- `ProsemirrorRichText::scanLinkExtension()` is deprecated in favor of a `RichTextExtension` implementation
- `ProsemirrorRichText::replaceLinkExtension()` is deprecated in favor of a `RichTextExtension` implementation

### Richtext compatibility parser

Prior to this update the Richtext compatibility parser responsible for supporting richtext syntax of HumHub < 1.3 was active by default and could not easily be deactivated. In HumHub 1.8 this parser is deactivated for new installations and can be deactivated for existing installation, which do not need to support richtext created with HumHub < 1.3. The compatibility parser can be deactivated in order to improve performance by configuration file:

```php
return [
    'modules' => [
        'content' => [
            'richtextCompatMode' => false
        ]
    ]
];
```

Version 1.7
-----------

### New WallEntry Layouts

The new `humhub\modules\content\widgets\stream\StreamEntryWidget` classes replaces the old `humhub\modules\content\widgets\WallEntry`.  
Beside the `StreamEntryWidget`, which is now the base class for all kinds of stream entries, there are two different widget types for 
wall streams (e.g. Dashboard, Space, Profile) the `humhub\modules\content\widgets\stream\WallStreamEntryWidget` 
and `humhub\modules\content\widgets\stream\WallStreamModuleEntryWidget`. 

#### humhub\modules\content\widgets\stream\WallStreamEntryWidget

The `WallStreamEntryWidget` renders a similar as the current but enhanced stream entry layout with the user 
image and user name in the head section of the stream entry. This widget type should be used for content which 
emphasizes the author of the content and contains mainly personal (not collaborative) content.

#### humhub\modules\content\widgets\stream\WallStreamModuleEntryWidget

The `WallStreamModuleEntryWidget` on the other hand is new and does not emphasize the user, but instead the content 
type and the content title.  This widget should be used for content types in which the author is not that important 
as for example a wiki or other collaborative content.

#### Migration

The old `humhub\modules\content\widgets\WallEntry` widget was deprecated and modules should be migrated as soon as possible.

**Old Post WallEntry:**

````php
namespace humhub\modules\post\widgets;

class WallEntry extends \humhub\modules\content\widgets\WallEntry
{
    public $editRoute = '/post/post/edit';

    public function run()
    {
        return $this->render('wallEntry', ['post' => $this->contentObject, 'justEdited' => $this->justEdited]);
    }

}
````

**New Post WallEntry:**

````php
use humhub\modules\content\widgets\stream\WallStreamEntryWidget;

class WallEntry extends WallStreamEntryWidget
{
    public $editRoute = '/post/post/edit';

    protected function renderContent()
    {
        return $this->render('wallEntry', ['post' => $this->model, 'justEdited' => $this->renderOptions->isJustEdited()]);
    }
}
````

**Example of WallStreamModuleEntryWidget:**

```php
use humhub\modules\content\widgets\stream\WallStreamModuleEntryWidget;

class WallEntry extends WallStreamModuleEntryWidget
{
    public $editRoute = '/mymodule/mycontent/edit';

    protected function renderContent()
    {
        return $this->render('wallEntry', ['model' => $this->model, 'renderOptions' => $this->renderOptions]);
    }

    protected function getIcon()
    {
        // By default we do not have to define an icon unless we want to overwrite the default ContentActiveRecord::$icon
        return 'tasks';
    }

    protected function getTitle()
    {
        return $this->model->title;
    }
}
```

##### Integration of other ContentTags

In the old WallEntry widget all content labels returned by  `ContentActiveRecord::getLabels()` as topics 
and content specific badges were added to the head section of the stream entry. 
In the new layout the topics are the only content tags which are automatically rendered. 
Content specific tags now need to be manually integrated into the body part of the stream entry. 

Example:
 
  - Closed Poll
  - Task state 
  - Wiki category 
  - Canceled event
  - Calendar Type

##### WallEntry::run()

Sub classes of `WallStreamEntryWidget` need to implement the `renderContent` instead of `run`. 

##### WallEntry::getContextMenu()

In the old `WallEntry::getContextMenu()` was renamed to `WallStreamEntryWidget::getControlsMenuEntries()` widget class context entries should be added as follows

```php
public function getContextMenu()
{
  $result = parent::getContextMenu();
  $this->addControl($result, [SomeLink::class, ['content' => $this->contentObject], ['sortOrder' => 200]]);
  return $result;
```

In the new WallStreamEntryWidget class you should directly add the widget or array definition to the result array e.g.:

```php
public function getControlsMenuEntries()
{
  $result = parent::getContextMenu();
  $result[] = [SomeLink::class, ['content' => $this->contentObject], ['sortOrder' => 200]];
  return $result;
```

The `WallEntry::controlsOptions` is not available anymore replace:

 - `$controlsOptions['prevent']` with `$this->renderOptions->disableControlsEntry()`
 - `$controlsOptions['add']` with simple `$result[] = $linkdefinition`

##### WallStreamEntryOptions

Within your `WallStreamEntryWidget` you now can use `WallStreamEntryOptions` to change the behavior or appearance of
your `WallStreamEntryWidget` depending on the view context.

**Here are some usecases:**

- We may want to disable some menu items in the modal or search view since they do not work or are not expected in this context
- You want to display the whole content of a post (without read more) in the single stream entry view, but not in the container or dashboard stream
- A dashboard stream entry adds some additional information as the target container while this information is not rendered in container streams.
- We may want to disable stream entry addons and most of the controls on archived content
- We want to implement a custom stream and overwrite the default widget class bound to the ContentActiveRecord
- Content which was edited can be highlighted
- You want to disable the default edit link, and replace it with your own implementation

### Deprecations in stream and stream action logic

The following deprecations were added to the Stream class and moved to a `humhub\modules\stream\actions\LegacyStreamTrait`

 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::$mode` (which is not in use since 1.5)
 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::$from` was replaced with `StreamQuery::from` (which is not new the old property is just deprecated and was not in use)
 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::$to` was replaced with `StreamQuery::to` (which is not new the old property is just deprecated and was not in use)
 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::$activeQuery` - `StreamQuery::query()` should be used to access activeQuery directly
 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::getContentResultEntry()` was deprecated and replaced with `StreamEntryResponse::asArray()` or `StreamEntryResponse::asJson()` should be used
 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::renderEntry()` was deprecated and replaced with `StreamEntryWidget::renderEntry()`
 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::setupCriteria()` and `setupFilters()` are deprecated, in order to set filters or manipulate the query you should overwrite `Stream::beforeApplyFilters()`or `Stream::afterApplyFilters()`
 - `humhub\modules\stream\actions\Stream::MODE_NORMAL`, `Stream::MODE_ACTIVITY`, `Stream::FROM_DASHBOARD` are replaced with `StreamEntryOptions::viewMode` (only the FROM_DASHBOARD was active anyways)
 - `humhub\modules\content\components\ContentActiveRecord::getWallOut()` was replaced with `StreamEntryWidget::renderEntry()`

### Other 1.7 Migration Issues

- The sort order for Menu Entries or BaseStack (e.g. Sidebars) classes should now be set to a maximum of 10000. If no sort order is specified, the sort order is set to 9000.

- Classes (LDAP, HTTP Client) from the deprecated Zend Framework have been replaced by the compatible Laminas Framework. There is a compatibility layer but classes should be replaced up to HumHub 1.8. 

- Removed `humhub\modules\space\widgets\Picker` which is deprecated since `v1.2`.

- Removed class `humhub\widgets\RichtextField` which is deprecated since `v1.4`. 


Version 1.6
-----------

No breaking changes.


Version 1.5
-----------

### Asset Management

In HumHub 1.5 the loading of core assets was optimized by splitting the main `humhub\assets\AppAsset` into two separate
bundles. The old AppAsset, which was reduced to only a few core scripts and stylesheets and a new `humhub\assets\CoreBundleAsset`.
The CoreBundleAsset contains other core dependencies which are not as essential and will be loaded with a [defer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-defer)
script attribute, which means those assets are not available immediately within the html body while not blocking the site rendering process.

You'll have to follow one of the migration options described below in case your scripts depend on one of the following assets:

 - JqueryColorAsset, 
 - JqueryHighlightAsset,
 - JqueryAutosizeAsset,
 - Select2Asset,
 - Select2BootstrapAsset,
 - JqueryWidgetAsset,
 - NProgressAsset,
 - JqueryNiceScrollAsset,
 - BlueimpFileUploadAsset,
 - BlueimpGalleryAsset,
 - ClipboardJsAsset,
 - ImagesLoadedAsset,
 - HighlightJsAsset,
 - SwipedEventsAssets,
 - CoreExtensionAsset,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.modal.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.form.elements.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.form.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.showMore.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.panel.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.progress.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.gallery.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.ui.picker.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.oembed.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.media.Jplayer.js`,
    - `js/humhub/humhub.client.pjax.js`,
 - ProsemirrorEditorAsset,
 - ProseMirrorRichTextAsset,
 - UserAsset,
 - LiveAsset,
 - NotificationAsset,
 - ContentAsset,
 - ContentContainerAsset,
 - UserPickerAsset,
 - FileAsset,
 - PostAsset,
 - SpaceAsset,
 - TopicAsset,
 - FilterAsset,
 - CommentAsset,
 - LikeAsset,
 - StreamAsset,
 - ActivityAsset,
 - SpaceChooserAsset
 
:::tip
It is recommended to migrate to deferred scripts loading even if you don't depend on the CoreBundleAssets.
:::

:::info
In case your scripts are exclusively loaded by ajax for example within the wall stream, you don't have to care about
the CoreBundleAsset dependency.
:::

#### AssetBundle Migration

If your AssetBundle depends on the CoreAssetBundle you'll need to add deferred script loading to your scripts.

**HumHub >=1.5 only migration:**

If you don't plant to stay compatible with older HumHub versions you can manage the script loading by
extending the `humhub\components\assets\AssetBundle`, which will make use of deferred script loading by default.
Don't forget to update `"humhub": {"minVersion": "1.5"}` within your `module.json`. 

```php
use humhub\components\assets\AssetBundle;

class MyAssetBundle extends AssetBundle
{    
   //... 
}
```

:::info
The new `humhub\components\assets\AssetBundle` provides some new useful features and default settings besides the script loading management.
:::

**HumHub < 1.5 compatibility**

In case you want to stay compatible with older HumHub versions, you can enable the `defer` script loading by setting 
a `$defer` property as in the following example. This property will simply be ignored in HumHub versions < 1.5.

```php
use yii\web\AssetBundle;

class MyAssetBundle extends AssetBundle
{
   // Activate deferred script loading (this prop
   public $defer = true;
    
   //... 
}
```

The following example enables deferred script loading even on HumHub versions < 1.5.

```php
use yii\web\AssetBundle;
use yii\web\View;

class CoreBundleAsset extends AssetBundle
{
    //...

    public $jsOptions = [
        // Make sure scripts are added after CoreBundleAsset
        'position' => View::POS_BEGIN, 
        'defer' => 'defer'
    ];
}
```

#### Script Migration

The following options are available to migrate non deferred scripts as for example inline scripts which are
dependent on CoreAssetBundle.

**Use of `humhub:ready` listener**

The `humhub:ready` event is triggered once all modules are loaded and initialized.

```javascript
$(document).one('humhub:ready', function(event, isPjax, humhub) {
    var stream = humhub.require('stream');
    // do stuff...
});
```

You can also define modules within a `humhub:ready` event handler,
this will also ensure all dependencies are available and may be useful when working with inline scripts.

```javascript
$(document).one('humhub:ready', function(event) {    
    humhub.module('myModule', function(module, require) {
        var stream = require('stream');
        // do stuff...
    });
});
```

:::info
By using `one` instead of  `on` we make sure our handler is only executed once, otherwise the handler would be executed
on each `pjax` page transition.
:::

**HumHub module module `init()`**

The `init` function of your HumHub javascript module will always be called once all scripts are available.

```javascript
// myModule.js
humhub.module('myModule', function(module, require) {
    
    /**
     * Outside of init some modules may not be available, so make sure to follow one of the other migration options
     * when using requiring a js module included in CoreAssetBundle.
    */

    module.export({
        init: function(isPjax) {
            // All scripts are loaded and stream dependency is available
            var Stream = require('stream').Stream;
        }
    })
});
```

#### Deactivate deferred script loading

If none of the above migration options makes you happy, you can disable the deferred script loading as follows:

**Globally within `config.php`**

```
/protected/config/common.php
return [
    'components' => [
        'assetManager' => [
            'preventDefer' => true
        ]
    ]
]
```

### Default lazy javascript module loading

In HumHub 1.5 modules required by `humhub.require()` will be fetched lazily by default, which means a module will be
initialized by `require()` in case it has not been loaded yet. In HumHub <1.5 a lazy flag was required to be set in `require`
e.g. `require('moduleId', true)`. This behavior was introduced in order to be more tolerant regarding script loading order
due to the core asset loading change. Since lazy loaded modules are rarely used on purpose a warning is logged to the console
once a module was loaded lazily for troubleshooting. 

:::warning
Lazy module loading only works on real modules and not on exported classes:

```javascript
// Can be required lazily and will be available in init at the latest
var stream = require('stream');

// Can not be required lazily and won't be available if the module was not loaded already
var Stream = require('stream.Stream');
```
:::

### Other changes

Some assets bundles were removed from the AppAsset, in case one of them is required in your custom module,
you should register them manually or even better include them in your custom module since they probably will be removed 
in an upcoming release:

**Deprecated:**

- Removed legacy `humhub\assets\PagedownConverterAsset` from AppAsset
- Removed legacy `humhub\assets\JqueryCookieAsset` from AppAsset
- Removed legacy `resources/file/fileuploader.js` from AppAsset
- Removed legacy `resources/user/userpicker.js` from AppAsset
- Removed legacy `js/humhub/legacy/jquery.loader.js` from CoreApiAsset
- Removed legacy `js/humhub/legacy/app.js` from CoreApiAsset
- Removed legacy `js/humhub/humhub.ui.markdown.js` from CoreApiAsset 
- `SocketIoAsset` is only registered on demand
- Deprecated `humhub\modules\ui\form\widgets\MarkdownField` in order to favor `humhub\modules\content\widgets\richtext\RichTextField`


**Loaded on demand:**

- Removed `humhub\assets\SocketIoAsset` from AppAsset

Version 1.4
-----------

### CSP and Nonce support

Please test your modules against the `security.strict.json` rules and mention possible incompatibilities in your module
description.

In order to support [CSP nonces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) 
you should either completely avoid using inline scripts or use one of the techniques described 
in the [Javascript Guide](javascript.md). Its furthermore recommended to avoid inline styles, as they may be restricted
in the strict CSP rule in a future version as well.

### Menus

The menu system has been revised, is mostly downward compatible, but the old API methods/views will be removed with the next HumHub 1.5 version.

Please adjust your module menus accordingly. More details can be found in the [Menu](menus.md) chapter of the developer documentation. 

### Language codes

Following language codes has been changed.

If you're using any custom modules, please change the message directories accordingly.

| Old language code| New language code |
|----------|-------------|
| en | en-US |
| en_gb | en-GB |
| pt_br | pt-BR |
| nb_no | nb-NO |
| nn_no | nn-NO |
| zh_cn | zh-CN |
| zh_tw | zh-TW |
| fa_ir | fa-IR |


### Removed deprecated methods
