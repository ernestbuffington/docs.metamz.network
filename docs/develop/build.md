title: HumHub Build
---

HumHub provides some [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) tasks to ease the execution of some console commands. This guide describes how to setup
grunt and run these commands. All grunt tasks need to be run within your HumHub root.

## Setup Grunt 

 1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
 2. [Install Grunt CLI](https://gruntjs.com/using-the-cli)
 
```console
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

 3. call `npm install` in your HumHub root

## Build production assets

HumHub uses Yii`s build-in mechanism for [compressing and combining assets](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/structure-assets#combining-compressing-assets)
as javascript or stylesheet files in combination with grunt. Those compressed assets are only used when running 
in [production mode](../admin/security.md#enable-production-mode) and in [acceptance tests](testing.md#run-acceptance-tests).
When running in debug mode, separate assets files are used to ease development and debugging.

When running a [development environment](environment.md#gitcomposer-installation), you'll have to manually build those
production assets in order to run acceptance tests (or testing the production mode). The production build will compress
scripts and stylesheets configured in `humhub\assets\AppAsset` into the following files:

- `@humhub/static/js/all-*.js`
- `@humhub/static/css/all-*.css`

#### Grunt based build

The simples way to build your production assets is by running the following grunt task:

```console
grunt build-assets
```

#### Manual build

1. Delete the content of your `static/assets` directory.
2. Delete the old compressed file `@humhub/static/js/all-*.js` and `@humhub/static/css/all-*.css`
2. Run the following command within your `protected` directory:

```console
php yii asset humhub/config/assets.php humhub/config/assets-prod.php
```

## Build themes

HumHub themes consist of many less files within the `/less` directory of a theme. The `grunt build-theme` task can be used
to build the community theme or other themes residing in the `@humhub/themes` directory. For this command you'll need to
install [Less](http://lesscss.org/usage/):

```console
npm install less -g
```

### Build community theme

To rebuild the community theme run:

```console
grunt build-theme
```

### Build custom themes

To build another theme residing in the `@humhub/themes` directory run:

```console
grunt build-theme --name=MyTheme
```

:::info
Refer to the [Theming Guide](../theme/css.md) for more information about custom themes.

### Manual theme build

To build a theme without grunt, run the following command:

```console
lessc -x themes/HumHub/less/build.less themes/HumHub/css/theme.css
```

## Search index rebuild

Grunt task for rebuilding your [Search Index](../admin/search.md)

```console
grunt build-search
```

## Run migration

Grunt task for running database [migrations](models.md#scheme-updates).

The following command will run the migration for core and modules:

```console
grunt migrate-up
```

Run core migrations only:

```console
grunt migrate-up --module=0
```
## Testing

Run test server:

```console
grunt test-server
```

Run tests:

```console
grunt test
```
:::info
See [Testing Guide](testing.md) for more use cases of the `grunt test` task.
