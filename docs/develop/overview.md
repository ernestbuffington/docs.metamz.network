## The HumHub platform

HumHub provides a powerful modular platform based on the [Yii2 Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com).
The modular nature of HumHub allows developers to add new features or change the behavior of existing core 
features by means of custom modules.

Languages used throughout the platform are: 

- **PHP**
- **JavaScript**
- **SQL (MySQL/MariaDB)**
- **HTML**
- **CSS/Less**

HumHub is based on the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) 
pattern and uses frontend frameworks such as: 

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/)
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/).

In this guide you will find all the necessary information in order to customize your HumHub installation and implement your own modules.
Since HumHub is based on the [Yii 2.0 PHP Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) make sure you're also familiar with the basic concepts of Yii2:

## Core modules and components

The HumHub core consists of a set of core modules, components, widgets, helpers and views, which can be used within your
custom modules and are described in more detail within the [Module Development](modules.md) section.

HumHub extends several Yii components such as:

 - `humhub\components\ActiveRecord`
 - `humhub\components\Application`
 - `humhub\components\AssetManager`
 - `humhub\components\Controller`
 - `humhub\components\Event`
 - `humhub\components\ActiveRecord`

 - `humhub\components\Module`
 - `humhub\components\Request`
 - `humhub\components\Response`
 - `humhub\components\Theme`
 - `humhub\components\UrlManager`

## Application structure

The following structure lists the main directories of a HumHub installation, whereas the `humhub` directory will be referred as
 `web-root` throughout this guide.

```
humhub
├── assets
├── protected
│   ├── config
│   ├── humhub
│   ├── modules
│   ├── runtime
│   └── vendor
├── static
├── themes
└── uploads
```

- `assets` - Contains published assets as scripts and stylesheets managed by [AssetBundles](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/structure-assets#asset-bundles).
- `protected` - Contains files as core and module sources and configuration files. The access to this directory needs to be protected 
in an production environment.
  - `config` - Contains user configuration files.
  - `humhub` - Contains all HumHub core files'
  - `modules` - This is the default directory used for searching for external modules.
  - `runtime` - Contains runtime related files as **cache**, **search index** and **logs**
  - `vendor` - Contains third party libraries
- `static` - Static asset files as production assets, core javascript/less files etc.
- `uploads` - File uploads, profile images etc.
